LED Flashlight
--------------

This is a simple implementation of an LED flashlight for Android
handsets (Mostly only works with older Motorola phones). It activates
the Camera Flash LEDs to turn the phone into an efficient flashlight.

It has a homescreen widget for activating/deactivating the lights, as
well as some convinience controls to control how long the lights stay
on. You can also choose a style for the widget. Nothing fancy, and
admitedly out of date, but the technique was neat at the time, as it
uses refelection to expose some classes that were not documented by
Google at the time. 

The last tested version of Android for this app was Android 2.3, so it
probably won't work well on newer phones, although the Google Play
comments seem to indicate it still works fine on some newer Motorola
phones.

I take no responsibility if this breaks your shiny phone. You've been
warned.
